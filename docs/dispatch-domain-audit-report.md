## 1. File Inventory

- `components/dispatch/dispatch-skeleton.tsx`
- `components/dispatch/dispatch-board.tsx`
- `components/dispatch/load-form.tsx`
- `components/dispatch/load-details-dialog.tsx`
- `components/dispatch/load-card.tsx`
- `features/dispatch/recent-activity.tsx`
- `lib/actions/dispatchActions.ts`
- `lib/fetchers/dispatchFetchers.ts`
- `hooks/use-dispatch-realtime.ts`

- `types/dispatch.ts`
- `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/dispatch/[userId]/page.tsx`
- `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/dispatch/[userId]/new/page.tsx`
- `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/dispatch/[userId]/edit/page.tsx`
- `app/api/dispatch/[orgId]/updates/route.ts`
- `app/api/dispatch/[orgId]/stream/route.ts`

## 2. Dependency & Architecture Analysis

- **No circular dependencies detected.**
- **Imports/exports** are clean and follow the domain structure.
- **No unused code** or duplicate logic found in actions/fetchers.
- **Types and schemas** are consolidated and used consistently.
- **Clerk, RBAC, and Prisma** are correctly integrated for authentication, permissions, and data access.

---

## 3. Cleanup & Refactoring

- All files are organized by domain: UI in `components/dispatch/`, business logic in `features/dispatch/`, server actions in `lib/actions/dispatchActions.ts`, fetchers in `lib/fetchers/dispatchFetchers.ts`, types in `types/dispatch.ts`, and schemas in `schemas/dispatch.ts`.
- No dead code or legacy files remain.
- Import paths are up to date and unused imports removed.
- Client/server separation is enforced: interactive UI is client, data fetching is server.

---

## 4. Documentation Updates

- **Developer Documentation:**
  - Architecture, RBAC, and API details for dispatch updated in `docs/Developer-Documentation.md`.
  - Dispatch domain structure and responsibilities clarified.
- **User Documentation:**
  - Dispatcher and admin guides updated in `docs/User-Documentation.md`.
  - Step-by-step instructions for creating, assigning, and managing loads.

---

## 5. Validation & Metrics

- **TypeScript:** No errors in any dispatch domain files.
- **Linting:** No lint errors.
- **Tests:** (Skipped as requested)
- **Production readiness:** All checklist items complete, no technical debt.

**Metrics:**

- Files before/after: No unnecessary files remain.
- LOC reduced by removing dead/duplicate code.
- All dependencies are current and minimal.

---

## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps

- Continue to monitor for new duplication as features evolve.
- Next audit: focus on another domain (e.g., analytics or compliance).

---

**Sign-off:**

- Technical review complete
- Documentation updated
- Ready for next domain
